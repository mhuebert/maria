;; # Gallery

;; Here are some ways to use shapes in Maria. They’re here for you to browse and play with.

;; Some of these were made by first-day programmers after working through [Learn Clojure with Shapes](http://www.maria.cloud/intro), where most (but not all!) of the Clojure programming techniques used are explained. See also [Welcome to Cells](https://dev.maria.cloud/cells). To figure out the parts that aren’t explained, we recommend experimenting with the code. You can do that directly in the code blocks below, or in your own playground using the Duplicate button at the top of the screen. Cheers! 🦋

;; #### Colorization functions

;; Demonstrated with ranges
(map #(colorize % (square 50))
     (map #(hsl % 100 50) (range 0 250 25)))

(map #(colorize % (square 50))
     (map #(hsl 120 % 50) (range 0 100 10)))

(map #(colorize % (square 50))
     (map #(hsl 120 50 %) (range 0 100 10)))

(map #(colorize % (circle 25))
     (map #(rgb % 0 0) (range 0 250 25)))

(map #(colorize % (circle 25))
     (map #(rgb 0 % 0) (range 0 250 25)))

(map #(colorize % (circle 25))
     (map #(rgb 0 0 %) (range 0 250 25)))

;; variable opacity
(map
  #(opacity % (colorize "blue" (triangle 40)))
  (range 0 1 0.1))

;; color gradient
(apply above
  (map #(colorize (hsl (rescale % 0 1000 120 220) 90 90)
                (rectangle 500 5))
     (range 0 1000 5)))

;; #### Rolling triangle rainbow
(apply layer
  (concat [(colorize "white" (rectangle 750 75))]
          (map #(->> (triangle 25)
                     (position (* 2 %) 20)
                     (rotate %)
   	                 (colorize (hsl % 90 75)))
               (range 0 360 15))))

;; #### Cartwheel rectangles
(layer

  (apply beside
       (map #(->> (rectangle 30 50)
                  (rotate %)

;; #### Minimal cells demo: sampling from a palette every quarter-second
(let [palette ["red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "blue" "indigo" "violet"]]
  (cell (interval 250 #(colorize (rand-nth palette) (square 50)))))

;; #### Confetti
(defn confetti []
  (let [palette (cycle ["aqua" "springgreen" "magenta"])]
    (->> (repeat 20 (triangle 20))
         (map #(position (rand-int 500) (rand-int 500) %))
         (map colorize palette)
         (cons (colorize "#eeeeee" (rectangle 550 550)))
         (apply layer))))

;; try it–more than once!
(confetti)

;; Use cells to have the computer do it for us every 1/10 of a second:
(cell (interval 100 confetti))

;; #### User interfaces and Adjustible shapes

(defcell shape-size 16)

(cell (html [:div
             [:h2 "Adjustable Triangle"]
             [:input {:type "range"
                      :on-input #(reset! shape-size (-> % (.-currentTarget) (.-value) int))}]
             [:div (colorize "aqua" (triangle @shape-size))]]))

;; Note that both the `shape-size` cell's reported value and the circle itself change when you move the slider. This happens because the function attached to on-input is `reset!`ing the `shapesize`, which then communicates that change to every cell that depends on it.

;; We can use this same mechanism to store reactive state for an application, for example by placing a map with multiple entries in a cell:

(defcell some-state
  {:size 20
   :colors ["magenta" "cyan" "yellow"]})

;; ... then assigning some behavior that updates what's in the state map. For example, when you click on this circle it will change its size and color:

(cell (->> (colorize (first (@some-state :colors))
                     (circle (@some-state :size)))
           (listen :click #(swap! some-state assoc :size (+ 20 (rand-int 10))
                                  :colors (shuffle (@some-state :colors))))))

;; #### Halloween pumpkin
(layer
 (position 40 60 (colorize "orange" (circle 40)))
 (position 10 30 (colorize "black"  (triangle 24)))
 (position 45 30 (colorize "black"  (triangle 24)))

 (position 25 74 (colorize "orange" (rectangle 10 5)))

 (position 33 82 (colorize "orange" (rectangle 10 5)))
 (position 35 2  (colorize "black"  (rectangle 10 20))))

;; #### Labeled color swatches:
(take 10 color-names)

;; `color-names`-style swatches for every possible shade of blue
(filter #(clojure.string/includes? % "blue")
        color-names)

;; #### RGB color picker
(defcell app-state {:red 0 :green 0 :blue 0})

(defn update-state [color]
  #(swap! app-state assoc color
          (int (* 2.55 (-> % (.-currentTarget) (.-value) js/parseInt)))))

(cell
  (html [:div
	  [:p "red"]
          [:input {:type "range" :default-value "0" :on-input (update-state :red)}]
   	  [:p "green"]
          [:input {:type "range" :default-value "0" :on-input (update-state :green)}]
   	  [:p "blue"]
          [:input {:type "range" :default-value "0" :on-input (update-state :blue)}]
          [:div (colorize (rgb (:red @app-state) (:green @app-state) (:blue @app-state))
                          (square 200))]]))
